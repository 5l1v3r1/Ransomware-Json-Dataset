##JSON Dataset

JSON dataset work is based upon the many efforts of Mosh (@nyxbone) and @cyb3rops who manage Ransomware Summary public spreadsheet that is co-hosted in this repository. Spreadsheet data remains the intellectual property of Mosh and is taken 'as-is' and processed into a JSON output to allow its use in various shell or programming operations.
